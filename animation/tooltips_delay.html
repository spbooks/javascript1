            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_T._Kirk">James Tiberius Kirk</a>
        (2233 - 2293/2371), played by William Shatner, is the leading character in the
        original Star Trek TV series and the films based on it. Captain Kirk commanded
        the starship <span class="ship">Enterprise</span>
        (<a class="federation"

      <p>Kirk's adventures and tactics are legendary in the Alpha and Beta Quadrants
        and continue to be cited well into the 24th century. He had a relaxed and
        confident style of command, but didn't suffer fools gladly. As Captain Benjamin
        Sisko said later about the iconic commander, he had "quite the reputation as a
        ladies' man". Kirk's record with Starfleet's Department of Temporal
        Investigations was unrivaled, with seventeen infractions. He ordered the
        <span class="ship">Enterprise</span> into multiple blatant violations of the
        Prime Directive.</p>
